#Arduino IDE JPEGDECODER examples.


## [SerialCsvOut](https://github.com/fredericplante/JPEGDecoder/tree/master/examples/SerialCsvOut)

  + Original example comming with [Makoto's picoJPEG libraries](https://code.google.com/p/picojpeg/).
  + Work on Mega256, Due AND ESP8266

## [TFT_SDcard_jpg_v1](https://github.com/fredericplante/JPEGDecoder/tree/master/examples/TFT_SDcard_jpg_v1)

  + Original example comming with [BODMER's JPEGDecoder libraries](https://github.com/Bodmer/JPEGDecoder).
  + Work on Mega256, Due AND ESP8266

## [TFT_flash_jpg_v2](https://github.com/fredericplante/JPEGDecoder/tree/master/examples/TFT_flash_jpg_v2)

  + Original example comming with [BODMER's JPEGDecoder libraries](https://github.com/Bodmer/JPEGDecoder).
  + Work on Mega256, Due. ESP8266 dont use FLASH this way.

## [TFT_SPIFFS_jpg_v3](https://github.com/fredericplante/JPEGDecoder/tree/master/examples/TFT_SPIFFS_jpg_v3)

  + New in this distribution of the JPEG decoder library. 
  + It only Work on ESP8266 because it use the SPIFFS libraries.

## [TFT_SPIFFS_jpg_v3_1_partialJPEG](https://github.com/fredericplante/JPEGDecoder/tree/master/examples/TFT_SPIFFS_jpg_v3_1_partialJPEG)

  + Need to be done. Help is on it's way, hang n tight! :D
  + New in this distribution of the JPEG decoder library. 
  + It will only Work on ESP8266 because it use the SPIFFS libraries.
  
## [TFT_Serial_jpg_v4](https://github.com/fredericplante/JPEGDecoder/tree/master/examples/TFT_Serial_jpg_v4)

  + Need to be done. Help is on it's way, hang n tight! :D
  + New in this distribution of the JPEG decoder library. 
  + Will read the JPEG from serial port.
